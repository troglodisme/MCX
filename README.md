# Reality Interface

## Project description
 
This research project investigates the role of conventional physical user interfaces in an increasingly augmented world.
Will we retain some of the tangible interactions we have grown accustomed to as interfaces and screens merge with our Reality even further? 
I built a series of experiments to interact with Augmented Reality using physical inputs, such as a potentiometer. 

### Tools ###
- Unity 3D
- Arduino
- OSC


### Demos ###

(I didn't have an encoder at hand, so still using a slider for now)

### Some thinking ###
With the proliferation of augmented reality devices (ðŸ‘“ soon?), users might want a seamless and intuitive way to interact with both digital and physical elements in their environment. I was curious to see if and how these two could cohabit in our home environement, and how we could interact with mundane things such as our thermostats, sound systems, doorbells and calendars. 

In this context, physical inputs like knobs or buttons can provide a tangible and intuitive way for users to control and manipulate digital content. By incorporating these physical inputs into augmented reality scenarios, designers can create more immersive and engaging experiences that feel more like real-world interactions.

I experimented with connecting a microcontroller (ESP32) to Unity using OSC, in order to allow the user to interact physically with digital elements (currently displaying text and modifying the posigion of 3d elements).

Overall, this quick experiment allowed me to get a basic understanding of the tools needed to prototype interactions in augmented reality. Much more work is needed to develop a deep understanding of both physical and digital interactions, as well as a to experiment and iterate to find the most effective and engaging design solutions. With the right approach, designers will be able create truly transformative experiences that blur the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds.
